# Robby The Robot
A versatile simulator for programming various robotic tasks.  The simulator environment is programmed in C++ and SFML, while a libraries for scripting robots are being developed for Python and Java.  Interprocess communication is done with pure sockets, so more language support is possible in the future.

### Current Features

- Differential-drive motor control with acceleration
- Gyro sensor for reading rotational velocity
- Multicolor pen control for drawing (inspired by the logo turtle)
- Distance sensor (mild work in progress)
- Scalable input and output structures for adding virtual io

### Progress

I'm currently writing a Java implementation for FRC and FTC teams.
