# Robby The Robot
A versatile simulator for programming various robotic tasks.  The simulator environment is programmed in C++ and SFML, while a library for scripting robots is being developed for Python.  Interprocess communication is done with pure sockets, so more language support is possible in the future.

### Current Features

- Differential-drive motor control with acceleration
- Gyro sensor for reading rotational velocity
- Pen control for drawing (inspired by the logo turtle)
- Scalable input and output structures for adding virtual io
- Mac and Linux support

### Progress

Working on expanding functionality and extensibility.
